                Nearly all of the genome sequences and annotations in our database are the product of a decade's hard
                work performed by the SEA-PHAGES students, teaching assistants, and faculty.
                We created Phamerator to help them discover and share the story of their phages.

                Phamerator is continually developed by the <a href="cresawnlab">Cresawn lab</a> in James Madison
                University's Center for Genome and Metagenome Studies.
