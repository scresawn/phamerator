                        Bacteriophages are genetically diverse and incredibly numerous. Current estimates suggest there are about 10 billion times as many bacteriophages on planet Earth
                        as there are stars in the universe!

                        Nearly all of the genome sequences and annotations in our database are the product of a decade's hard work performed by the SEA-PHAGES students, faculty, and teaching assistants.
                        We developed Phamerator to help them discover and share the story of their phages.

                        Phamerator is developed by the <a href="cresawnlab">Cresawn lab</a> in James Madison University's Center for Genome and Metagenome Studies.
